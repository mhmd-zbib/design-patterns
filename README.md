# Design Patterns Playground

This repo is my hands on playground for learning, practicing, and testing all the classic design patterns in software engineering. I'm splitting them up into their own folders:

- **behavioral**
- **structural**
- **creational**

Each pattern gets its own code example, and I'm keeping things organized so it's easy to find and experiment with any pattern you want.

## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are tried and true solutions to common problems you run into when designing software. They're not code you copy paste, but more like templates or blueprints for solving problems in a clean, reusable way.

I'm doing this project to really get a feel for how these patterns work in practice not just theory. Everything here is written, tested, and organized by me as I go, so it's a living, learning project.

Feel free to poke around, try things out, or use this as a reference for your own learning.
